      <!-- start description -->
    <p>A classic lasagna recipe features layers of wide pasta noodles, rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and gooey melted mozzarella. Start by preparing the meat sauce with ground beef, onions, garlic, and tomatoes, seasoned with Italian herbs. In another bowl, mix ricotta with egg, Parmesan, and fresh parsley. Layer cooked lasagna noodles in a baking dish, followed by meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella. Repeat the layers and finish with a top layer of cheese. Bake in the oven until bubbly and golden brown. Let it rest before slicing and serving for a delicious, hearty meal.</p>
