    <h1>A PIZZA</h1>
<img src="images/pizza.jpeg" alt="image of a pizza">
<p>Making pizza at home is simple and rewarding! Start with a basic dough made from flour, yeast, water, and salt. After kneading and letting it rise, roll it out into a round shape. Preheat your oven to a high temperature. Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Add your favorite toppings, such as shredded mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, bell peppers, and olives. Bake for about 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Let it cool slightly before slicing, and enjoy your homemade pizza!
